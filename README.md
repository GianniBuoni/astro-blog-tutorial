## Takeaways

- I like the way the server and client side rendering are handled in Astro.
- I'm still a little shaky on how define the types of awaited Objects, but that's not too different than NextJS (though, NextJS has server actions and TRPC Library to counteract this)
- Can it integrate with TRPC?
