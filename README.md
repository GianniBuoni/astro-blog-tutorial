# I'm learning Astro!

## Links

- [Tutorial](https://github.com/coding-in-public/astro-blog-tutorial)
- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)

## Takeaways

- I like the way the server and client side rendering are handled in Astro.
- I'm still a little shaky on how define the types of awaited Objects, but that's not too different than NextJS (though, NextJS has server actions and TRPC Library to counteract this)
- Can it integrate with TRPC?

## Extra TILs

[Typescript Paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#paths)

- Set up path shortcuts in the tsconfig early to make life easier.
- I like to have dedicated aliases for at least the `components` and `lib`
